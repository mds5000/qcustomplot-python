/*! \class QCPAbstractPlottable
  \brief The abstract base class for all data representing objects in a plot.

  It defines a very basic interface like name, pen, brush, visibility etc. Since this class is
  abstract, it can't be instantiated. Use one of the subclasses or create a subclass yourself (see
  below), to create new ways of displaying data.
  
  All further specifics are in the subclasses, for example:
  \li A normal graph with possibly a line, scatter points and error bars is displayed by \ref QCPGraph
  (typically created with \ref QCustomPlot::addGraph).
  \li A parametric curve can be displayed with \ref QCPCurve.
  \li A stackable bar chart can be achieved with \ref QCPBars.
  \li A box of a statistical box plot is created with \ref QCPStatisticalBox.
  
  \section plottables-subclassing Creating own plottables
  
  To create an own plottable, you implement a subclass of QCPAbstractPlottable. These are the pure
  virtual functions, you must implement:
  \li \ref clearData
  \li \ref selectTest
  \li \ref draw
  \li \ref drawLegendIcon
  \li \ref getKeyRange
  \li \ref getValueRange
  
  See the documentation of those functions for what they need to do.
  
  For drawing your plot, you can use the \ref coordsToPixels functions to translate a point in plot
  coordinates to pixel coordinates. This function is quite convenient, because it takes the
  orientation of the key and value axes into account for you (x and y are swapped when the key axis
  is vertical and the value axis horizontal). If you are worried about performance (i.e. you need
  to translate many points in a loop like QCPGraph), you can directly use \ref
  QCPAxis::coordToPixel. However, you must then take care about the orientation of the axis
  yourself.
  
  From QCPAbstractPlottable you inherit the following members you may use:
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>QCustomPlot *\b mParentPlot</td>
    <td>A pointer to the parent QCustomPlot instance. This is adopted from the axes that are passed in the constructor.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QString \b mName</td>
    <td>The name of the plottable.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>bool \b mVisible</td>
    <td>Whether the plot is visible or not. When this is false, you shouldn't draw the data in the \ref draw function (\ref draw is always called, no matter what mVisible is).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QPen \b mPen</td>
    <td>The generic pen of the plottable. You should use this pen for the most prominent data representing lines in the plottable (e.g QCPGraph uses this pen for its graph lines and scatters)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QPen \b mSelectedPen</td>
    <td>The generic pen that should be used when the plottable is selected (hint: \ref mainPen gives you the right pen, depending on selection state).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QBrush \b mBrush</td>
    <td>The generic brush of the plottable. You should use this brush for the most prominent fillable structures in the plottable (e.g. QCPGraph uses this brush to control filling under the graph)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QBrush \b mSelectedBrush</td>
    <td>The generic brush that should be used when the plottable is selected (hint: \ref mainBrush gives you the right brush, depending on selection state).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QCPAxis *\b mKeyAxis, *\b mValueAxis</td>
    <td>The key and value axes this plottable is attached to. Call their QCPAxis::coordToPixel functions to translate coordinates to pixels in either the key or value dimension.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>bool \b mSelected</td>
    <td>indicates whether the plottable is selected or not.</td>
  </tr>

  Clears all data in the plottable.
*/

/*! \fn double QCPAbstractPlottable::selectTest(const QPointF &pos) const = 0
  
  This function is used to decide whether a click hits a plottable or not.

  \a pos is a point in pixel coordinates on the QCustomPlot surface. This function returns the
  shortest pixel distance of this point to the plottable (e.g. to the scatters/lines of a graph).
  If the plottable is either invisible, contains no data or the distance couldn't be determined,
  -1.0 is returned. \ref setSelectable has no influence on the return value of this function.

  If the plottable is represented not by single lines but by an area like QCPBars or
  QCPStatisticalBox, a click inside the area returns a constant value greater zero (typically 99%
  of the selectionTolerance of the parent QCustomPlot). If the click lies outside the area, this
  function returns -1.0.
  
  Providing a constant value for area objects allows selecting line objects even when they are
  obscured by such area objects, by clicking close to the lines (i.e. closer than
  0.99*selectionTolerance).
  
  The actual setting of the selection state is not done by this function. This is handled by the
  parent QCustomPlot when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs.

/*! \fn void QCPAbstractPlottable::draw(QCPPainter *painter) = 0

  to \ref sdNegative and all positive points will be ignored for range calculation. For no
  restriction, just set \a inSignDomain to \ref sdBoth (default). \a validRange is an output
  parameter that indicates whether a proper range could be found or not. If this is false, you
  shouldn't use the returned range (e.g. no points in data).
